3. Look for the "htmx" tab in the DevTools panel. If you don't see it, click on the ">>" icon to find it in the list of additional tools.

### Debugging htmx Events

The debugger automatically captures htmx events as they occur on the page. Each event is displayed with the following information:

-   Event type
-   Timestamp
-   Target element details
-   Event-specific details
-   XHR information (for relevant events)

### Using the Debugger Features

1. **Connection Status**: Check the connection status indicator in the panel header to ensure the debugger is properly connected.
2. **Search**: Use the search bar at the top to filter events based on their content.
3. **Clear**: Click the "Clear" button to reset the debugger and remove all captured events.
4. **Event Filtering**: Use the filter buttons to show all events, only requests, or only responses.
5. **Expand/Collapse**: Click on an event header to expand or collapse its details.
6. **Timing Information**: For grouped events, the total duration is displayed at the bottom of the group.

## Troubleshooting

-   If you don't see any events in the debugger, ensure that the webpage you're debugging is actually using htmx.
-   If the htmx tab doesn't appear in DevTools, try reloading the page or reopening DevTools.
-   Check the browser console for any error messages related to the extension.
-   If the connection status shows "Disconnected", try reloading the page.
-   If problems persist, try disabling and re-enabling the extension, reloading the webpage, or restarting Chrome.
